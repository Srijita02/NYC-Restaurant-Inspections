    "## 1. **Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used the NYC Restaurant Inspection Results dataset obtained from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) [1]. There are over 270,000 rows and 27 columns containing records of inspections in all major restaurants and cafes across New York City, conducted between 2015 and 2025, and associated safety violations. Each violation is presented as a distinct row, with repeated fields for each additional violation if multiple violations occur in a single inspection. Grades are assigned to each violation based on inspection scores as follows [5]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspection score of 0–13: Grade A (Excellent compliance)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspection score of 14–27: Grade B (Adequate compliance)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspection score of 28+: Grade C (Poor compliance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since thousands of restaurants go out of business every year, the dataset only includes restaurants and eateries with an \"active\" status. Restaurants are identified by their unique CAMIS ID. We also have data about restaurants with no violations and new establishments that are yet to be inspected (having 01/01/1900 as the inspection date). \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has information about time and location (latitude and longitude) which makes it ideal for our study. We are analyzing temporal trends and geographic patterns in NYC restaurant hygiene and their inspection scores, and this notebook presents our exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling results. Our main visualizations, as part of our explanatory data analysis, are hosted on GitHub [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in exploring how restaurant inspection results and safety violations in New York City correspond to a restaurant’s location and the type of cuisine it serves. Why do some restaurants consistently receive better grades, while others face more critical violations? Are certain neighborhoods or cuisines more prone to facing health issues or perhaps scrutinized more closely, indicating racial bias? By analyzing these patterns, we hope to uncover whether factors like time of inspection, geography, or cuisine type influence inspection results and highlight threats in food safety. It is particularly important because restaurant hygiene directly affects public health. Every day, millions of New Yorkers dine out, and if the restaurants do not comply with safety standards, they might pose major health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset offers a rich, real-world view of public health and food safety across one of the most culturally diverse and densely populated cities in the world — New York. It combines geographic and temporal data, allowing us to study how inspection scores and violations vary across time, location, and restaurant types, transparency or biases in inspections, and restaurant compliance behaviour. Understanding which neighbourhoods or cuisines face more challenges or tighter scrutiny can reveal important insights into how inspections are conducted and where stringent food safety regulations should be enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to create an engaging, interactive website which would present our data-driven findings in a lucid, easy-to-understand format for non-technical readers. We want our users to be able to explore and understand restaurant hygiene and food safety patterns in New York City, not just through complex statistics or boring charts but through intuitive and fun visualizations that would pique their interest. We have presented our explanatory data analysis through dynamic bar plots and line charts and interactive maps, aimed to help users observe trends in hygiene scores, critical violations, and how these relate to a restaurant’s location or cuisine. We want to enable non-scientific users (diners, business owners, and policy makers) to be able to make informed, data-driven decisions about food safety standards in NYC restaurants."

    "- ### Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing.\n",
    "Since our dataset contains real-world records, we came across certain wrong entries and missing values which needed thorough cleaning and preprocessing before we could analyze it. We started by dropping the columns that we did not intend to keep for our analysis ('CAMIS', 'BUILDING', 'ZIPCODE','PHONE','VIOLATION CODE','GRADE DATE','RECORD DATE','Community Board','Council District','Census Tract','BIN','BBL','NTA','Location Point1'). We also dropped rows that had missing or NaN values. We noticed that some entries had wrong grade entries against the ispection scores while yet others had grade 'Z' to denote 'grade pending; even though the violation had received a valid inspection score. To handle these issues, we designed a function to revise the grades based on the inspection scores (0-13: A, 14-28: B and 28+:C). We converted the values in the INSPECTION_DATE to a valid date format and added a new column ('Year'). We also removed rows where the latitude and longtiude values were 0.0. Our dataset was initially 116.12 MB, having 277482 rows and 27 columns. After cleaning and pre-processing we are left with 51049 row and 14 columns. "

    "Looking at the basic statistics and the Scatter plot in Figure 1, we observe that 2024 had the highest number of inspections in NYC (17201), followed by 2023 (12067) and 2022 (12067). 2016 recorded the least inspections - only 47. Recent years (2022 onwards) saw a rise in inspections as DOHMH made recovery attempts to resume inspections post-COVID [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inspected restaurants lie in the latitude range of approx. 40.5° N and 40.9° N and an approx longitude range of -73.2° W and -73.7° W. The latitude-longitude distribution of NYC restaurants can be visualized in Figure 2. The dense central region likely corresponds to Manhattan, followed by Brooklyn while the other surrounding NYC boroughs have sparse restaurant locations and this aligns with the fact that Manhattan has over 10K eateries while Brooklyn has 8K+ [4]. Figure 3 shows that Manhattan has recorded the greatest number of inspections, followed by Brooklyn and Queens, closely depending on the number of eateries in these boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found that the inspection scores in our dataset lie between 0.0 to 154.0 and have a mean value of 15.69, median 12.0 and standard deviation of 12.48. There are comparable number of 'Critical' and \"Not Critical' flags (25525 and 25524 respectively) in the violations. Cycle Inspection - Initial Inspection or Re-Inspection together account for the most common inspection types. 36978 violations received grade 'A' (Excellent), 8408 received 'B' (Adequate) while 5663 received 'C' (Poor). Figure 4 shows a stacked bar plot with the number of inspections for each grade and what fraction of these are 'Critical' vs 'Not Critical'. For grade 'A' there are similar number of 'Critical' and 'Not critical' violations while for 'B' and 'C', there are higher no. of 'Critical' cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5 gives an overview of the different cuisine types popular in NYC grouped into broader categories and the number of inspections for each. American food is by far the most common cuisine, dominating the chart with the largest bubbles. Asian, European and Latin American cuisines are also fairly popular whereas Mediterranean and African cuisines have the least no. of establishments in NYC. The popularity of American cuisine is due to the city's culture and history and tourists wanting to get a flavour of local dishes [6], whereas interests towards Asian cuisines are also on the rise, refleting the city's diverse demographics [7]."

    "- ### Describe your data analysis and explain what you've learned about the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of the NYC Restaurant Inspection dataset involved both exploratory and explanatory techniques. We cleaned the data by removing irrelevant columns, dropping columns with missing or NaN values, converting date fields into a valid format, and assigning inspection grades based on the inspection scores received. We then extracted some descriptive statistics and created some preliminary plots to understand the distribution of yearly violations, restaurant locations, inspection scores and grades and cuisine types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scatter plot of yearly inspections (Figure 1) shows a clear increase in the number of restaurant inspections in NYC post-pandemic and 2024 had the highest count. We have also analyzed Restaurant Location Distribution as a scatter plot (Figure 2) and the spread of restaurants shows dense clustering around central latitudes and longitudes, particularly in Manhattan and Brooklyn. A bar plot of Inspections per Borough (Figure 3) has shown that Manhattan and Brooklyn not only have the highest number of eateries but also receive the highest number of inspections. This suggests that inspection frequency is proportionate to restaurant density. We have also included a stacked bar plot of Grades vs Critical/Not Critical Violation (Figure 4) which shows most violations are graded 'A', showing good compliance city-wide. However, for grades 'B' and 'C', the share of critical violations is significantly higher, suggesting a deterioration in hygiene standards among lower-graded restaurants. Figure 5 is a bubble chart of Cuisine Types in NYC and it can be observed that American cuisine dominates the NYC food scene in terms of popularity, followed by Asian, Latin American, and European cuisines. Mediterranean and African cuisines have comparitively lower numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our explanatory data analysis, we have included interactive bar plots, geo maps, an interactive line chart and a calender plot to present our findings (Figures 8-13). Our six main visualizations provide a comprehensive picture of restaurant inspections across New York City from multiple angles. Daily and monthly inspection plots reveal consistent temporal variations, with inspections peaking in early spring and higher activities during midweek, while sharply dropping during summers and on weekends. Geographic maps show that central boroughs like Manhattan maintain higher hygiene standards, while others like Queens and the Bronx display greater variability, with more Grade 'B' and 'C' establishments. An animated choropleth map highlights a significant rise in inspection numbers post 2021, after the pandemic, especially in Brooklyn, Queens and Bronx. Over time, inspection activity by cuisine shows American food dominating over other cuisine types, with post-pandemic growth in categories like Coffee/Tea. Finally, a violation breakdown by cuisine type reveals that while American restaurants receive the most violations overall, Chinese restaurants face more critical violations suggesting uneven risk profiles across cuisines and emphasizing the need for more food safety enforcement for certain cuisines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- ### If relevant, talk about your machine-learning.\n",
    "We applied linear regression to model inspection scores received by restaurants across New York City and we also studied the correlation between the number of inspections for top 5 most popular cuisines through pairwise scatter plots. These are helpful in both descriptive and predictive analysis, helping uncover patterns and validate assumptions about how inspection scores and numbers are distributed and how they’re evolving with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we trained a regression model to predict inspection scores based on features like borough, cuisine type, critical/not critical flag, inspection grade, and inspection year. We applied one-hot encoding to the categorial features and splitted the dataset - 80% for training and 20% for testing. Our model achieved a strong R² score (0.76) and low RMSE (6.18). We fitted a regression line to the scatter plot of the average inspection scores over the years (Figure 6.a). It revealed a steady rise in average inspection scores over time — indicating declining hygiene standards. Higher inspection scores indicate poor compliance to safety standards [5] and can be attributed to improper food storage temperatures, inadequate sanitation practices, pest infestations, and poor personal hygiene among staff [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "We compared predicted vs. actual inspection scores across boroughs using a boxplot and stripplot (Figure 6.b). This plot helps us to visually compare how well the model predictions align with actual inspection results in each borough and the clustering of red diamonds around the boxplot centers indicates good accuracy achieved by our model. Manhattan shows highest compliance to hygiene standards compared to all other NYC boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the reliability of our model, we plotted the distribution of residuals using a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with histogram (Figure 6.c). The residuals are centered around zero, indicating good model prediction and the slight right-skewedness shows our model underestimates some inspection scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used regression in a matrix of pairwise scatter plots across the top 5 cuisine types (Figure 7), to quantify the relationships among these cuisines and to analyze how inspection numbers correlate between them. Each subplot includes slope and intercept values with the fitted regression line, helping quantifying similarities and differences in inspection frequency for the top cuisines. The plots show strong diagonal correlation, indicating consistency over time. Thus, when inspections increase for one cuisine, others tend to follow."

    "**Figure 6(a):** Fitting regression line to the scatter plot of average inspection scores across the years (2016-2025). We can observe a clear upward trend in average inspection scores from 2016 to 2025, as captured by the linear regression fit. Since higher scores indicate more violations [5], this trend suggests a gradual decline in restaurant hygiene compliance citywide over the decade. The post-2020 increase is especially sharp, likely reflecting disruptions caused by the pandemic followed by a surge in inspections [3]. This insight helps us identify a systemic trend that may require increased enforcement or public health interventions, especially if this rise in scores reflects genuine operational risk. These violations directly impact food safety and could be due to improper food storage temperatures, inadequate sanitation practices, pest infestations, and poor personal hygiene among staff [9].\n",

    "**Figure 6(b):** Box and Stripplot showing actual vs predicted inspection scores for each NYC borough. It shows how well our linear regression model predicts inspection outcomes in each borough. The clustering of red diamonds (predicted scores) around the blue boxplot centers (actual score distributions) suggests that the model performs reliably overall. Inspection scores in Manhattan are tightly clustered with a lower median than other boroughs, with fewer outliers indicating better overall hygiene and higher compliance. Queens and the Bronx display broader variation with more number of outliers, suggesting the potential for stricter enforecement of safety standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 6(c):** Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with histogram showing the distribution of residuals. The histogram of residuals shows that the majority of predictions are fairly accurate, with residuals centered close to zero. However, the slight rightward skew indicates that the model occasionally underpredicts some inspection scores, meaning it slightly overestimates hygiene quality in some cases. There are no extreme outliers, and the distribution is roughly symmetrical, which supports the assumption of normally distributed residuals, indicative of a good regression model. This plot thus proves that our model is overall balanced and reliable."

    "- ### **Explain the visualizations you've chosen.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected six main visualizations to show our data analysis results about restaurant inspection patterns in NYC from 2016 to 2025:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monthly Restaurant Inspections by Borough (bar plot) - Figure 8**\n",
    "   This shows the monthly or seasonal rhythm of inspections across boroughs. It is an interactive plot that has months on the x-axis and no. of inspections on the y-axis and we can select which borough(s) to analyse. It effectively highlights how inspections peak in spring, drop in summer, and rise again in December. It also allows clear comparison of inspection activities in each Borough and we find Manhattan records the most number of inspections while Bronx and Staten Island record the least.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inspection Occurrences Per Day (calendar heatmap) - Figure 9**\n",
    "   This day-level calendar plot visualizes trends for each day of the week across all the years. It is a static plot with each day of the year represented as a box and coloured according to intensity of inspections higher number of inspections - higher intensity). Number of inspections per day vary from 0 to above 400 in recent years. It reveals inspection cycles (e.g. concentrated midweek activity), pandemic-related drop-offs in 2020, and intensified inspections 2022 onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NYC Restaurant Locations and Grades (interactive scatter map) - Figure 10**\n",
    "   This interactive map helps visualize spatial distribution of inspection grades. It is an open street map of NYC and all the restaurants in our dataset are represented by the dots, plotted according to their precise latitude and longitude values. Restaurants that received grade 'A' (Excellent Compliance) are represented by green, followed by orange for 'B' (Adequate Compliance) and red for 'C' (Poor Compliance). Hovering over each dot shows detailed information such as restaurant name, cuisine, address, inspection score and grade received. It’s effective in revealing geographic clustering of grades - higher Grade A density in Manhattan, indicating better food safety standards vs. more Grade B/C in outer boroughs, showing need of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Yearly Inspection Numbers by Borough (choropleth map with yearly slider) - Figure 11**\n",
    "   This animated choropleth map shows borough-level inspection trends over time. Each borough is coloured based on intensity (higher number of inspections - higher intensity) and hovering over each shows the name of the borough, year to which the slider is set, average inspection score and no. of inspections that year. It shows how inspections in boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn surged post-pandemic while Manhattan consistently recorded the highest numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inspections Over Time by Cuisine Type (line plot with policy markers) - Figure 12**\n",
    "   This interactive time series plot links inspection activity by cuisine type to major events like COVID lockdown and policy changes in NYC. It has no.of inspections on y-axis and years on the x-axis. It allows the user to set trend lines for particular cuisine types that might be of special importance to them. It's especially useful to highlight how inspection numbers for the different cuisines were affected by major events in the city. Cuisines like American and Chinese have recorded growing numbers of inspections post covid whereas Afghan still records very low numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Critical vs. Non-Critical Violations by Cuisine (grouped bar chart) - Figure 12**\n",
    "   This interactive chart compares the severity of violations (Critical/Not Critical for the top 10 cuisine types. Green shows Non Critical whereas red shows Critical. Hovering over the bars also shows the cuisine name and no. of inspections. This plot shows not just frequency of violations but also the associated risk profiles, for example, higher critical violations in Chinese food and more balanced outcomes for Bakery and Pizza. American food has very high total no.of violations, though the count of critical is slightly higher than non critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### **Why are they right for the story you want to tell?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our story centers on **patterns in restaurant inspections**, **temporal and geographic variations**, and **potential compliance issues by cuisine types** in NYC. These visualizations are suitable for our data story because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Temporal charts:** (bar, line, calendar) reveal patterns in inspection cycles (monthly and yearly), impact of the pandemic and other policy-related issues on number of inspections in NYC in the last decade.\n",
    "* **Geographic maps:** help visualize precise restaurant locations using latitude and longitude values and also helps plot boroughs based on yearly number of inspections. It helps observe how number of inspections depend on how densely the restaurants are located in the different boroughs.\n",
    "* **Bar chart for the cuisine's critical/noncritical violations and bar chart to show number of inspections by borough:** to analyze whether certain cuisine types get more critical or non-critical flags during inspection and which boroughs record the highest number of inspections.\n",
    "* **Annotated line plots:** show yearly trends for each cuisine type and how inspections were affected by specific citywide events.\n",
    "* **Interactive elements:** for example, slider to select years for map, hover boxes to show detailed information, option to select which borough or which cuisine type, zoom-in/zoom-out options better engage users and allow them to explore trends that are of specific interest to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations go hand-in-hand to complete our narrative and help us balance exploration with explanation. We are thus able to present our findings about inspection patterns in an effective, interactive and engaging way to readers who have no background in Data Science or Data Analysis. Our analysis can help policymakers or inspection officers in NYC to take more informed, data-driven decisions about which areas of type of restaurants need more regular inspections. It can also help diners to choose safe restaurants that follow high food safety standards."

    "\n",
    "This chart presents the monthly distribution of restaurant inspections across NYC boroughs. A clear seasonal pattern emerges: inspections rise steadily from January, peak between February and April, and then drop sharply during the summer months (June–August). Toward the end of the year, particularly in December, there’s a notable increase again. Looking across boroughs, Brooklyn, Queens, and especially Manhattan consistently account for the highest number of inspections each month, while Staten Island has the fewest. This isn’t surprising. Manhattan has the largest concentration of restaurants in the city [4], so more inspections naturally follow. This trend is also supported by external sources, such as local news and food regulation reports. These observations point toward a structured inspection rhythm, likely influenced by a mix of policy, logistics, and the distribution of food businesses across the city [3,4].\n",

This weekly rhythm remains consistent across all years. What stands out, however, is the dramatic drop in activity during 2020 — a likely reflection of pandemic-related disruptions [3]. From 2021 onward, inspections begin to rebound, and in the last two years (2023–2024), we observe a notable increase not only in frequency but also in day-to-day coverage. This suggests a period of intensified inspection efforts post-COVID [3]. The first months of 2025 appear equally dense, though the year is still incomplete.It also highlights seasonal trends, such as dips during public holidays like Christmas or weather-related disruptions, and surges towards the beginning of the months where inspection cycles are concentrated.\n",

    "In the above plot, each line represents a specific cuisine, while vertical dashed lines indicate key regulatory or public health events (policy shifts such as Focus on Rat Mitigation in 2017 [10], Violation Score Change through the Launch of the Letter Grade Lookup App in 2018 [11], COVID-19 lockdown period from 2020 to 2021, and Focus on Kitchen Hazards in 2023 [12]). The plot highlights how inspection frequency varies by cuisine and responds to citywide initiatives and disruptions. It reveals that American cuisine consistently receives the highest number of inspections, peaking sharply after 2021. This suggests it may be the most prevalent category or one that receives focused regulatory attention. Chinese restaurants also show a steady inspection presence [7], with a smaller but noticeable increase in recent years. Tea/Coffee venues see a marked rise beginning in 2021, possibly due to the growth of small beverage outlets post-COVID. Meanwhile, Mexican restaurants maintain lower overall inspection counts, though they too show a modest rise after the pandemic. These trends reflect not only cuisine popularity but also possible operational shifts or inspection targeting policies over time.\n",

    "**Figure 13:** A comparison of violation severity among the top 10 cuisine types (Figure 6 from website).\n",
    "\n",
    "American cuisine leads the pack in total violations — which makes sense given how common it is. But when we look at the balance between critical and non-critical issues, some interesting differences pop up. Chinese restaurants, for example, have noticeably more critical violations, while places serving Bakery, Latin American food or pizza show a much more even split. Thus, not all cuisines face the same kinds of challenges during inspections. This comparison highlights not just how often violations occur, but also where compliance gaps may be more serious, helping to identify areas where targeted food safety interventions might be most needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "Looking at nearly a decade of restaurant inspections in New York City, clear patterns emerge. Inspections are far from random — they follow consistent rhythms tied to time of year, day of the week, and broader public health efforts. We observed that inspections peak in early spring, dip in the summer, and rise again toward the end of the year. Weekdays, especially Tuesday to Thursday, see the most activity, while weekends are largely avoided. The disruption in 2020 due to COVID-19 is stark [3], but so is the rebound — by 2024, inspection volumes across boroughs reached their highest levels in the dataset, particularly in Queens and Brooklyn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographically, Manhattan remains the most densely inspected borough and holds the highest concentration of top-grade restaurants [4]. In contrast, Brooklyn and Queens show greater variation in inspection outcomes, with more B and C grades, pointing to differing levels of compliance and possibly differing enforcement or infrastructure challenges. Staten Island and the Bronx, while less active overall, also reveal pockets of lower-performing establishments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Culturally, inspection patterns reflect both the popularity and operational realities of different cuisines. American food, the most common, dominates in inspection volume and total violations [6]. Chinese and Latin American cuisines show higher proportions of critical violations, while others like Italian and Japanese fare better in terms of compliance. Beverage-focused venues like tea and coffee shops have seen a post-pandemic surge, mirroring broader trends in urban dining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these findings tell an interesting story of a system that adapts — reacting to public health crises, shifting culinary trends, and neighborhood-specific challenges. They also highlight potential disparities worth exploring further: Why are some cuisines or neighborhoods flagged more often? Do these patterns reflect true risk, or variations in enforcement? While data can't answer all these questions on its own, thorough research of relevant news articles and blog posts about food safety and dining habits in New York City have supported our findings and have shown where smart, fair inspections can help in the better enforcement of regulations and help diners make safer, more reliable choices [3,4]."

    "## **6. Discussion. Think critically about your creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### **What went well?**\n",
    "One of the biggest strengths of our project was how well the visualizations worked together to tell a clear, focused story. Each chart served a purpose—whether it was showing seasonal inspection patterns, highlighting geographic differences in restaurant grades, or exploring how violations vary across cuisine types. We carefully discussed and debated about what each one added to the bigger picture and what would work best. Our interactive maps and temporal plots, in particular, give users a way to explore the data intuitively and study patterns on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of linear regression also added a strong analytical aspect to our data analysis. We trained a model to predict inspection scores using features like borough, cuisine, inspection year, grade, and violation severity. The results were an R² of 0.76 and RMSE of 6.18, indicating good model predictions. The model's performance was interpreted through visuals like a box and stripplot and residual KDE with histogram. We also used regression to show how inspection scores have gone up over time (which means hygiene has worsened) and to analyze correlation in inspection numbers across the top five cuisines. These regressions helped us go beyond surface-level patterns and actually start quantifying relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also brought in news articles and real-world context to back up our insights, like how staffing shortages after COVID led to delayed inspections, or how cultural differences in cuisine might explain certain violations. This helped ground our findings and added credibility to the story we were telling. Thus, our project combined data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and narrative to create an interactive and engaging website, that will be informative to policymakers, diners, and restaurant owners in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a team, we tried our best to cooperate and coordinate with eachother through endless brainstorming, numerous meetings and continuously exchange of ideas. We helped eachother when we were stuck, we created and re-created the plots several times to polish and make them look presentable. Our team-work and understanding went a long way to make this project successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ### **What is still missing? What could be improved? Why?**\n",
    "Despite its strength, there are definitely areas where this project could be stronger. For one, the dataset only includes active restaurants that had violations. That means we’re missing out on restaurants ones that closed down and due to non-availability of inspection scores, we had to drop restaurants that were yet to be inspected. So, while we can say a lot about NYC eateries, there are still these aspects that we cannot comment on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our linear regression model was helpful, but it’s also very basic. It doesn’t account for non-linear relationships or complex feature interactions. A more advanced model—like a random forest or gradient boosting might have captured more subtle and interesting trends, especially when dealing with messy real-world data. Also, we didn’t dive too deep into which features were most important for predicting hygiene scores. That’s something we could explore in the future. Further, we could have used linear regression to study correlation between the number of inspections in each borough. We also applied classification to model Critical vs Non-Critical violations using Logistic Regression and Rabdom Forest but our models did not perform well and did not really add to our data analysis. We could not improve their performance due to lack of time and thus decided against including the results in our notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the visualization side, while our plots are clean and well-labeled, we could improve interactivity and could focus a bit more on consistency - fonts and colour choices. For example, adding sliders for years in Figure 8, or letting users hover over the calendar heatmap (Figure 9) to see inspection details, would make the site more dynamic. And while we used external articles to support our claims, we’d love to bring in more complementary datasets—like complaints, closures, or neighborhood demographics in the future to dig deeper into why certain areas or cuisines perform worse than others. We tried our best to back our findings through news articles and blogs but we could have looked up more interesting incidents to perhaps uncover an aspect of the data that we might not have considered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, our site is very author-driven right now. We guide the user through a curated story, which is great for clarity but it limits exploration. Giving users tools to build their own views, compare specific neighborhoods or cuisines, or ask their own questions would make the experience even more engaging and insightful. In the future, we can update our website to a Dashboard style to increase flexibility for the user.\n",
